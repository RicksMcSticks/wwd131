      <h3>Hobbies, passions, and daily activities?</h3>
      <p>
        Staying active is a huge part of my life. Whether I’m hitting the gym, playing sports, or pushing myself in triathlon training, I love the challenge of constant improvement.  
        <span class="hidden-text">
          But beyond my own progress, one of the most rewarding things is helping others in the gym—seeing them grow stronger and achieve their goals with my guidance is an incredible feeling.  
          Fitness isn’t just about lifting weights or endurance; it’s about discipline, consistency, and pushing limits.  
          At the same time, my biggest motivation is building a future where I can support a family while doing what I love. Balancing passion, personal growth, and long-term goals keeps me focused every day.

      <h3>CAREER</h3>
      <p>
        I’m diving into web development, and every day feels like an opportunity to learn something new. There’s nothing like the thrill of writing code, solving problems, and seeing my ideas come to life on the screen.  
        <span class="hidden-text">
          Whether it’s crafting interactive websites or building fun projects, I love the process of turning logic into something visual and functional. The image here is a Snake game I recently made—one of my first real coding projects that pushed my skills and creativity.  
          Web development isn’t just a career path for me; it’s a passion that fuels my curiosity and excitement to improve every day. I can’t wait to keep leveling up and seeing where this journey takes me.

      <h3>Dancing</h3>
      <p>
        Partner dancing is one of my biggest passions. There’s something incredible about moving in sync with someone, feeling the rhythm, and just letting the music take over.  
        <span class="hidden-text">
          I recently competed in a dance competition and placed 4th with a partner I had never danced with before—it was such an awesome experience!  
          I love swing dancing, cha-cha, and tango, and I’ve dabbled in waltz and Viennese waltz. Whether it’s the energy of swing or the elegance of a waltz, dancing is an amazing way to connect, express, and just have fun.

      <h3>What values or beliefs are important to Cameron?</h3>
      <p>
        Family is at the core of who I am. I believe in building meaningful
        relationships rooted in loyalty, love, and mutual respect. While I have
        my own religious beliefs, what’s most important is having a partner who
        respects those beliefs and shares a mutual respect for theirs. My values
        reflect kindness, understanding, and the belief that we are all stronger
        together. These are the things I want to build my life around—and I’m
        excited to find someone who feels the same.
